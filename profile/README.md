## Autoexec Labs

Autoexec Labs is a personal engineering lab focused on building and operating a small platform stack end-to-end.

Current areas of work:
- Bare-metal Kubernetes on Talos
- Cluster networking with Cilium (eBPF)
- GitOps workflows and pull-request–driven change management
- Observability, reliability, and systematic debugging

### Repositories
- **homelab-docs** — design notes, operational documentation, and incident writeups
- **homelab-platform** — platform configuration (Talos, Cilium, core services)
- **homelab-clusters** — cluster and environment desired state managed via GitOps
- **portfolio-site** — long-form writeups and project log
- **svc-python-api** — backend service used to exercise platform workflows
- **svc-cpp-service** — native service for distributed systems and performance testing
- **svc-graphql-gateway** — API gateway layer
- **svc-frontend** — frontend application for end-to-end testing

This org is intentionally documentation-heavy: if something breaks, the fix should become a note, a checklist, or an incident writeup.
